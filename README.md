# YWIT-2023
The NetApp Young Women in Technology conference for 2023

## Workshops

### MicroPython on Microcontrollers
This workshop will introduce the student to Python coding, electronics, and project
design. We will building several projects ranging from simple to complicated. These
projects are based on the ESP8266 microcontroller which is running MicroPython and
they depend on some other electronics components such as LEDs, buttons, and more.
See the project guide for step by step instructions on each project as well as mini
tutorials for electronics and programming beginners.
