\chapter{Introduction}
This workshop will introduce the student to Python coding, electronics, and project
design. We will building several projects ranging from simple to more complex. These
projects are based on the ESP32-C3 microcontroller which is running MicroPython and
they depend on some other electronics components such as LEDs, buttons, and more.

Students are encouraged to make use of the written instructions, diagrams, and to
explore and play with the components for themselves to see how they work and what
they do. There are many online resources as well for learning.

Connecting the microcontroller to your computer may require the installation of a
USB driver. If so, download the driver for your OS from this page and install as instructed:
https://ftdichip.com/drivers/vcp-drivers/. Once installed successfully, unplug and replug
the USB cable into the microcontroller and then press the small reset button on the
microcontroller board labeled "R" (for reset).
